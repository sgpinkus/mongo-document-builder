# MONGO DOCUMENT BUILDER
Provides a simple proof of concept document proxy object to support progressively building a mongo document updateOne (or insertOne) query. Motivation was to provide a small part of what Mongoose provides - a poor man's implementation of a working object - and avoid the rest of the bloat.

# USAGE
See [./src/example.ts](./example.ts).
